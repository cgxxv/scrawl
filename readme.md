# todo-java-react

## About

I learned java a couple of years ago, but in my job java is not the main program language.

So I decide to write a little project for some evidence by my java skill and for a new job.

React is my favorite frontend framework, I use it for my sparetime project very often.

This is a todo graffiti project target at practice for java, springmvc and react-18.

BTW, I have written another todo in pure javascript several years ago.
